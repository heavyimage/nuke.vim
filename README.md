# nuke.vim
An integration package for the Foundry's [Nuke](https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/).  This is my first vim plugin so go easy on me!

# Included functionality
* Syntax highlighting / a simple ftdetect plugin for .nk/.gizmo files!
![Screenshot 1 of nuke.vim](https://github.com/heavyimage/nuke.vim/blob/master/doc/syntax.png "Screenshot of syntax hilighting")
* Use vim as a replacement for the builtin nuke (Nuke Studio / Hiero) script editor(s)

* See 'coming soon' (below) for more ideas I have for this package

# Motivation
* Faster iteration in nuke; vim movement / edit commands are much faster than nuke's script editor
* Learn more about vim plugin development / scripting
* Similar tools (see acknowledgement) failed to execute nuke code in the same context as the script editor meaning that you couldn't move back and forth between vim and the built in editor
* Similar tools don't seem to send the output back to vim to make debugging and iteration even faster
* It's a ridiculous idea that no one but me will actually use

# Requirements
* A copy of vim compiled with python support (check vim --version; if you don't have support, try installing an enhanced or "huge" verison of vim with more flags enabled)
* The Foundry Nuke (tested with version 10.0v2 on macOS and linux)

# Installation

* Copy plugin, doc, syntax, and ftdetect directories into your '~/.vim' directory.  If you use Pathogen and git (recommended!), instead clone nuke.vim into your ~/.vim/bundles directory:

	```bash
	    $ mkdir ~/.vim/bundles
	    $ cd ~/.vim/bundles
	    $ git clone https://github.com/heavyimage/nuke.vim
	```

* Source the server code distributed with nuke.vim (see: nuke/nukevim_server.py) in your menu.py either

    * via a symlink (prefered, in case there are updates to nuke.vim's server component pushed to github)

        ```bash
            $ mkdir ~/.nuke
            $ ln ~/.vim/bundles/nuke.vim/nuke/nukevim_server.py ~/.nuke/nukevim_server.py
            $ cat "#start nukevim server\n\nimport nukevim_server\n\nnukevim_server.start()" >> ~/.nuke/menu.py
        ```

    * or as a copy:

        ```bash
            $ mkdir ~/.nuke
            $ cp ~/.vim/bundles/nuke.vim/nuke/nukevim_server.py ~/.nuke/
            $ cat "#start nukevim server\n\nimport nukevim_server\n\nnukevim_server.start()" >> ~/.nuke/menu.py
        ```

    * The same code should work just fine for Nuke Studio -- for Hiero, you'll have to import the server in a slightly different way (consult the docs [here](https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/hiero/developers/1.8/hieropythondevguide/setup.html "Maniupulating the hiero plugin path").)

* Startup nuke and make sure there's a message at startup that looks something like this:
    ```bash
        nuke.vim server: listening on 127.0.0.1:10191
    ```

# Now the fun part!

Startup vim, and fill the buffer with a few python snippits

```python
    nuke.createNode("Blur")

    10+50

    import math
    for i in range(360):
        x = int(math.cos(math.radians(i))) * 500
        y = int(math.sin(math.radians(i))) * 500
        d = nuke.createNode("Dot")
        d.setXYpos(x, y)
```

Then, consider the chart below:

| Command | Pneuonic | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \<leader\>sn | (s)end to (n)uke | Send the selection (or the current line if nothing is selected) to nuke |
| \<leader\>sb | (s)end (b)uffer | Send the entire buffer to nuke |

You should be iterating in no time!  For more information, consult doc/nukevim.txt or me, via e-mail.

* Sylvain Delhomme's [VimNuke](https://bitbucket.org/sydh/vimnuke) plugin (itself an earlier clone of vimya)
* Toke Jepsen's [atom-foundry-nuke](https://github.com/tokejepsen/atom-foundry-nuke) for Atom
* [Ian Thompson](https://github.com/quornian) for providing a crucial bit of help

# Coming soon
* Improvements to vim-as-script-editor (see TODO)
* Nuke function python code completion in vim
* A terminal based node viewer
* Broaden into vfx.vim with setups for other apps?!
* Other cool ideas you send to me

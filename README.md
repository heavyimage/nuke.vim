# nuke.vim
An integration package for the Foundry's [Nuke](https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/).  This is my first vim plugin so go easy on me!

# What works now
* Syntax highlighting / a simple ftdetect plugin for .nk/.gizmo files!
* Use vim as a replacement for the builtin nuke script editor

# Coming soon
* Improvements to vim-as-script-editor (see TODO)
* Nuke function python code completion in vim
* A terminal based node viewer
* Broaden into vfx.vim with setups for other apps?!
* Other cool ideas you send to me

# Installation
* clone/download nuke.vim into your ~/.vim/bundles directory.  You're using Pathogen, right?
* That's it!

=======================================================================

1. Overview                                            *vimya-overview*

   Vimya can be used to execute the contents of a Vim buffer, the
   current visual selection, or a single command in Autodesk Maya. The
   plugin will save the command(s) to be executed in a temporary file
   and tell Maya via the command port to source this file. Both MEL and
   Python scripts are supported, Maya's log can optionally be opened in
   a separate preview window or tab in Vim.

=======================================================================

2. Requirements                                    *vimya-requirements*

   Python support is required for this plugin to run, check with
>
        vim --version
<
   Additionally, you may install the 'Tail Bundle' plugin, download it
   from
>
        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1714
<
   and install it before using Vimya to view the output of Maya (i.e.
   the stuff printed in the script editor) in Vim. You do not need to
   install it if you do not need this feature.

=======================================================================

3. Installation                                    *vimya-installation*

   When using the vimball (recommended, but requires the 'Vimball'
   plugin), all you need to do is open the file and source it:
>
        vim vimya-0.4.vba
        :so %
<
   When using the archive: Extract the contents and copy the files in
   the 'doc' and 'plugin' subfolders to the appropriate folders in your
   runtime path. Usually this is '~/.vim/' (see |'runtime-path'| and
   |add-global-plugin| for details). You may need to create the folders
   'doc' and 'plugin' if they do not exist.

   When all files are in place, start Vim and run the |:helptags|
   command to update the tags index.

   See |vimya-configuration| and |vimya-usage| for details on how to
   setup and use this plugin.

   You also need to open a command port in Maya. To open port 12345
   you may copy the following command to your userSetup.mel file:
>
        if (! `commandPort -q ":12345"`) commandPort -n ":12345";
<
   Refer to the Maya documentation for more details.

   Note that only INET sockets are supported at the moment, this may be
   A SECURITY RISK!

=======================================================================

4. Configuration                                  *vimya-configuration*

   This plugin uses the following configuration variables, they can be
   set in your |.vimrc| file:

   g:vimyaHost - string (default '127.0.0.1')
        Specifies the address of the host to connect to.

   g:vimyaPort - number (default 12345)
        The port number Maya is listening on for connections. See the
        short note above on |vimya-installation| and the Maya manual
        for details.

   g:vimyaDefaultFiletype - string (default 'python')
        Vimya needs to know if the code that should be executed by Maya
        is MEL or Python code. Usually this is determined by the
        current filetype. If the filetype is not set, e.g. when a new
        file is created, this default value is used. It must be set to
        either 'mel' or 'python'.

   g:vimyaShowLog - number (default 1)
        If you have the 'Tail Bundle' plugin installed and you do not
        want the Maya script editor log to be opened, set this variable
        to 0.

   g:vimyaTailCommand - string (default 'TabTail')
        The Tail Bundle command used to open the log (if enabled, see
        above). The default is 'TabTail' to open the log in a new tab.
        Set it to 'Tail' if a non-tabbed preview window should be used. 

   g:vimyaTempDir - string (default '')
        You may set this to a directory name to change the location of
        the temporary files. If it is an empty string (the default),
        the system's default temporary path will be used, as determined
        by Python's 'tempfile' library. See there for details.

   Example setting in your |.vimrc| file:
>
        let vimyaPort=54321
<
   The plugin will create the following mappings unless you configure
   your own mappings:

        nnoremap <leader>sm :py sendBufferToMaya ()<cr>
        vnoremap <leader>sm :py sendBufferToMaya ()<cr>
        nnoremap <leader>sb :py sendBufferToMaya (True)<cr>
        vnoremap <leader>sb :py sendBufferToMaya (True)<cr>

   See |vimya-usage| below for details on these function.

=======================================================================

5. Usage                                                  *vimya-usage*

   The Vimya plugin defines the following Python function for public
   use:
>
        sendBufferToMaya (forceBuffer = False, userCmd = None)
<
   If you call this function with
>
        :py sendBufferToMaya ()
<
   the code to be executed by Maya will be saved to a temporary file,
   and Vimya will send the appropriate commands to Maya to source this
   file.

   The current filetype - |ft| - must be set to either 'mel' or
   'python', or not set at all ('none'). If it is not set, the variable
   'g:vimyaDefaultFileType' is used to determine the correct commands
   to send to Maya. Other filetypes will cause an error message and no
   further actions to be performed.

   In visual mode, only the selected lines will be used unless you use
   the
>
        :py sendBufferToMaya (True)
<
   command, in that case the complete current buffer will be used. The
   complete buffer is also used when not in visual mode. Important: If
   a selection starts or ends in the middle of a line, this complete
   line will be executed!

   If you explicitely specify a command, i.e.
>
        :py sendBufferToMaya (userCmd = "<some command>")
<
   the buffer content (and visual selection) is ignored, and this
   command is used instead. Obviously, the forceBuffer parameter is
   also ignored in this case. Note that the comamnd will still be
   written to the temporary file first, and then this file will be
   sourced.

   It is suggested to map the commands you need to keyboard shortcuts,
   the default mappings are shown above. If you set up your own
   mappings, no default mappings will be created. See |key-mapping| for
   details. (Note: If you create one mapping for this function, you
   need to create the other mappings even if you want them to be the
   defaults, else they will not be available!)

   If the 'Tail Bundle' plugin is installed, the output of Maya will be
   written to a temporary log file and this file will be opened in a
   new preview tab (or window, see the 'g:vimyaTailCommand' option) in
   Vim, unless this behaviour is disabled by setting the variable
   'g:vimyaShowLog' to 0. See |:TabTail| or |:Tail| if installed.

   All temporary files are deleted automatically. The files sourced by
   Maya will be deleted by Maya itself: after the command to source the
   file the
>
        sysFile -delete [temporary file]
<
   MEL command is sent. The temporary logfile will be deleted when Vim
   is closed, do not delete it manually before you close Vim. The
   location of the temporary files depends on your system, unless the
   option 'g:vimyaTempDir' is set to override the default. See the
   Python documentation on 'tempfile.mkstemp' for details.

   Note: Since version 0.2 the plugin keeps track of all temporary
   files and tries to delete them when leaving Vim, since deleting
   with Maya's own commands did not always work. Additionally, when
   leaving Vim the command
>
        cmdFileOutput -closeAll
<
   is sent to Maya, which will close all open log files, before the
   plugin tries to delete the log file.

   The timeout for the communication with Maya is set to 5 seconds,
   which should be enough for connections to the localhost or to
   machines in the LAN, and there is currently no option to change
   this. If you need a higher value, modify the plugin's source code.
   You may file a bug report in this case, maybe I will add an option.

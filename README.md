# nuke.vim
An integration package for the Foundry's [Nuke] (https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/).  This is my first vim "plugin" so go easy on me!

# What works now
* Just syntax hilighting and a simple ftdetect plugin for .nk/.gizmo files!

# Coming soon
* A terminal based node viewer
* An ability to send python code from vim to nuke ala vim-slime
    * Base on similar project here: https://bitbucket.org/sydh/vimnuke/src
    * Use Nvizible's [NukeExternalControl](https://github.com/Nvizible/NukeExternalControl)
    * similar to: https://atom.io/packages/foundry-nuke or https://github.com/davidpaulrosser/atom-maya
    * more info: http://community.thefoundry.co.uk/discussion/topic.aspx?f=190&t=102660
* Other cool ideas you send to me

# Installation
* clone/download nuke.vim into your ~/.vim/bundles directory.  You're using Pathogen, right?
* That's it!
